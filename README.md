# `mootslive/mono`

Project is split into three parts:

- `/proto`: contains the Protobuf definitions for the API and the generated code.
- `/backend`: contains the Go backend services that power mootslive
- `/webapp`: contains the React webapp for interacting with mootslive.

## Resources

- <https://cloud.google.com/apis/design>: thing to roughly keep in mind when writing the protos. Linter enforces what it can.
